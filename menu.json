You may also get error code: 30009\n\nThis is a common issue that normally **happens when logging out of a bed**, or directly **after a 30k** error. The following workarounds have the best chances of fixing the issue:\n\n> **1.** Try selecting a different regional server before pressing the ‘Visit Location’ button. Try EU, US, AUS for example (top right). It's usually set to 'BEST'.  (may require several attempts)\n\n> **2.** Do the following in order, and all at the same time. Not separately:\n\n> - Exit the game and log out of the launcher\n> - Delete your User folder (program files\\Roberts Space Industries\\Star Citizen\\LIVE)\n> - Run the launcher as Admin, log back in and join the Stanton system again\n> - While in the loading screen, press ~ to open the console type QUIT, press enter\n> Join the Stanton System again and it may be fixed.\n\n> The above is a combination of **several methods** that seems to work.\n> Otherwise a [character reset](https://discord.com/channels/82210263440306176/900433210314461204/904976654487650315) should fix everything, provided you wait __at least 1 hour__ after resetting before getting back into the game.",
