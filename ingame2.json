Changing Regions in order to ensure a different server can help if you decide to server hop.\n\nOtherwise, there are 3 options for getting out of prison:\n\n**1.** Check your mission manager for the 'Fix 02 Kiosk', complete for merits\n\n**2.** Escape (you will need a buddy to pick you up)\n\n**3.** Wait it out (online or offline works)",

      "description": "In-game frame rates have a performance limit due to a few factors: \n\n**1.** The game client isn't heavily optimized yet and __no matter how good your PC hardware is, it will hit that ceiling__ until the game's engine/code is better optimized later in development.\n\n **2.** Any in-game event with its extra renderings will tank FPS no matter what.\nEven without events, in general, don't expect more than **__10-15__ in major planetary cities/spaceports. __20-30__ in space, and maybe __40-60__ if you're lucky in deep space.**\n\n```Guide to slightly better performance```\n> Set your game resolution to your monitor's native. \n> Fullscreen works best on most PCs. \n> Turn off Chromatic Abberation, Film Grain and Motion Blur. \n> Change Volumetric Cloud Detail to medium.\n> Vsync OFF unless you're playing on a TV or Ultrawide monitor. \n> Graphics quality preset to Medium if your CPU is better, or High if your GPU is better.\n> \n>  The game is very **CPU/RAM intensive** and the __lower the graphics, the more load it places on your processor__. Setting the graphics to high or very high shares much of the load between the CPU and GPU.\n\nFor NVIDIA GPU users: [double check](https://www.howtogeek.com/175281/how-to-force-graphics-options-in-pc-games-with-nvidia-amd-or-intel-graphics) that the game is using your __graphics card__ and not your CPU as the GPU. That issue normally only applies to **laptops**, but there are a handful of desktop motherboards that have that issue as well.\n\n```Force StarCitizen to use nVidia GPU```\n* Open the NVIDIA Control Panel\n* Click \"Manage 3D Settings\"\n* Click the \"Program Settings\" tab\n* Add the StarCitizen.exe file located by default in C:\\Program Files\\Roberts Space Industries\\StarCitizen\\LIVE\\Bin64\\\n* Select \"High-performance NVIDIA processor\" from the preferred graphics processor drop-down list\n\nIf you don't see that dropdown list, then you don't have that issue\n\nOther optimization settings:\nFor AMD graphics cards: https://youtu.be/K1N4vV5BSoI\n\nFor NVIDIA graphics cards: https://youtu.be/jZrnfWpENTo",
