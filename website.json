      "description": "If you had a Game Package and it is now missing, it is likely one of the following:\n\n1. You had a **Promotional Package** during a previous free fly event. This was not a Pledge that you paid for, but was a __temporary game pack to access the event__ while it ran.\n\n2. You melted (exchanged for store credits) your Game Pack and bought a **Standalone Ship** instead. Go back and buy a game pack, it is __required to access the game__.\n\n3. You paid for a ship through the **'grey market'**. If you did this and no longer have it, __check your emails from RSI Support__, as the ship was likely stolen and then returned to its proper owner. Don't risk it, buy direct from the [RSI Store](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge).",

      "description": "A [Character Reset](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041509433-Account-Reset) is a tool used when your in-game account or character is bugged and cannot be fixed using other workarounds.\n\n```What to use it for:```\nErrors and bugs such as:\n - Encountering an infinite loading screen.\n - Your character cannot interact with anything (doors, terminals, and ships).\n - All of your ships have become unflyable\n  - You are unable to complete the character creation process for some reason. \n\n```What NOT to use it for:```\n - Resetting your crime rating or reputations. \n - Recovering aUEC invested into lost armor, gear, or cargo\n\n```For best results:```\nExit the game and launcher completely, wait 5 minutes, Reset, wait 1 hour, and then log back into the launcher/game. **Waiting like this helps to avoid further corruption and loss of gear.**\n\n__The reset is not a wipe__, you will not lose everything, however certain things are removed to fix bugs:\n - Your ammo and medpens are removed to fix an inventory bug.\n - Your mission progress is reset\n - Your ship components will be reset to default (equipped custom components should be returned to storage)\n\n**You will not lose**: Money, Ships, Armor, Weapons, Attachments and Reputation.\n\n```\"It says my aUEC will be reset!\"```\nYes, reset to match the **Long Term Persistence Ledger**, __not wiped__. The LTP Ledger is __saved each time you play__ the game without issue, so you'll get back all your money from the last save.\n\n```\"But the page says to only wait 15 minutes?\"```\nIt actually says that you're **locked out of your account** for 15 minutes, not that the reset process __only takes 15 minutes__.\n\n__1 hour is the sweet spot__ that we've found ([and CIG agrees](https://i.imgur.com/8OPt9yu.gif)) over years of troubleshooting, **waiting less significantly increases** your chances of the reset process being interrupted and either __not fixing the issue or making it worse__.\n\nPerform a [character reset here](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account/reset).",
