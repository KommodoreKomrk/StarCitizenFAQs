If they are being updated, it will be labeled as **Live Deployment** and/or Star Citizen Alpha 3.x.x **LIVE** not PTU.\n\n**Server maintenance** may have an estimated timeframe of completion, but usually takes 2-4 hours to complete.\n**Patches** **__do not__** have a set timeframe of completion. It may take __30 minutes__, or __3 hours__.\n<#740956475853111427> will be updated when everything is back online.\n\n__Note:__ There is not a wipe every patch, and it is rarely announced beforehand.\nCheck <#585952222853201941> for the following keywords:\nLong Term Persistence: **Enabled** - Not a wipe\nLong Term Persistence: **Disabled** - There was a wipe\n\nA reset is not a wipe, therefore: Database Reset: YES or NO will not confirm a wipe.\nNormally, a full wipe will reset every player to only what is listed on their Account hanger (on the website), however going forward they will be able to wipe only portions of our accounts, separating the ships, inventory/gear, and money. (this portion will be updated later to reflect that)",
